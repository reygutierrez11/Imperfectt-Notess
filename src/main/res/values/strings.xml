        This app is designed to be simple and effective. Get started by clicking the dots on the upper
     right corner and selecting Add Note/Goal. From here you have two options, you can either type in
    your note and or goal using your own format, or you can back out back into the main menu and see that
    a preformatted note has been added!
        \n
        \nThis note contains 4 different items. The first is the name of the goal you desire. Then we have the
     ceiling version of that goal, or rather the best case scenario for accomplishing that goal. Then
    we have a floor goal, which is the lowest barrier you are willing to accept to consider the goal
    accomplished. It helps to think of what you might be able to accomplish in regards to this goal
    during a really difficult and sluggish day. Finally we have a system of 7 boxes which can be used
    to track your progress for the week.
        \n
        \n
    Once can simply place an x in the boxes such as follows: [x ] [x] [x ] [x] [ ] [] [ ]
        \n
        \n
    Remember that regardless if you hit a ceiling or floor objective, you check a box. It is all about consistency.
